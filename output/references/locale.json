You will see the game improve day after day!",

A screenshot is especially helpful!",

A name that has your first and last name in it\nb. A name that is in a non-English language\nc. A name that violates a trademark (Such as “Pepsi”)\n\nThere are other reasons that a name may be rejected, but these are easy ones to avoid.",
